[00:15.92]We rise together as our destiny unfolds
[00:21.98]We face the darkness and our trials are yet untold
[00:29.76]Through the shadows of despair
[00:33.50]Oh in silence hopes we share
[00:37.22]To chase our dreams that we've declared
[00:44.74]We glimpse through our eyes
[00:48.48]Yet fools blind our sights
[00:52.16]Can't make what they say
[00:55.29]We'll find our way we'll find our way
[00:59.26]Heads up The wheels are spinning
[01:04.08]Across the plains in valleys deep
[01:07.22]To dawn the wheels that sing
[01:11.59]An unending dream
[01:14.88]Heads up the tracks are running
[01:19.03]Across the plains where shadows hide
[01:22.35]We run we stride
[01:30.86]In the face of fear and plight and yet we hold our ground
[01:37.18]In life we stand and strive our victory is found
[01:44.85]And the storms we've weathered through
[01:48.43]And we hope in the light of truth
[01:52.04]To break free from chains and come anew
[01:59.98]Heads up The wheels are spinning
[02:03.64]Across the plains in valleys deep
[02:07.43]To dawn the wheels that sing
[02:11.44]An unending dream
[02:14.94]Heads up the tracks are running
[02:19.07]Across the plains where shadows hide
[02:22.49]We run we stride
[02:42.39]Heads up A steady rhythm
[03:03.87]A destination that's ever near
[03:07.36]It comes Stride to our kingdom
[03:11.44]And see the light of day
[03:14.93]Heads up the wheels are singing
[03:18.83]The whispers and secrets they'd keep
[03:22.34]To hope We bound
[03:31.04]Break free we chased our dreams beneath the starry night
[03:38.33]In the face of god we rose as one

[00:07.22]曾许下心愿 等待你 的出现
[00:14.16]褪色的秋千 有本书 会纪念
[00:21.29]我循着时间 捡起梦 的照片
[00:28.37]童话还没有兑现 却需要说再见
[00:37.33]如果有一天 岁月晕开书页
[00:43.44]请把我 模糊的字迹当作 笑脸
[00:50.68]很久前 想象 今天 画面
[00:55.90]哭着 笑着 告别
[00:58.47]陌生的情节 熟悉的侧脸 都重叠 oh~
[01:04.86]出发前 无数 星光 缱绻
[01:10.20]有回忆 落在 指尖
[01:15.98]当世界向前 我会在原地 流连
[01:51.20]当漪涟 一滴 一点 出现
[01:56.33]轻轻 去向 天边
[01:58.92]不管多遥远 都是追不上 的思念 oh~
[02:05.40]会不会 可能 还能 相见
[02:10.65]再回头只看一眼
[02:19.56]当漪涟 消散 万千 不见
[02:24.85]永恒和瞬间都 被爱意成全
[02:28.88]我的明天叫做昨天 Hoo~
[02:33.74]要相信 浪漫 一如 初见
[02:39.04]请笑着 向我 道别
[02:44.84]最后这一页 就让它无言
[02:51.95]我会在扉页 等待你续写 起点

[00:13.25]Birds are born with no shackles
[00:18.74]Then what fetters my fate
[00:25.19]Blown away the white petals
[00:30.39]Leave me trapped in the cage
[00:36.78]The endless isolation
[00:39.78]Can't wear down my illusion
[00:42.69]Someday I'll make a dream unchained
[00:49.46]Let my heart bravely spread the wings
[00:53.62]Soaring past the night
[00:56.34]To trace the bright moonlight
[01:01.48]Let the clouds heal me of the stings
[01:05.57]Gently wipe the sorrow off my life
[01:10.00]I dream
[01:19.21]What is meant by "miracle"
[01:24.81]A word outside my days
[01:29.80]Once again repeat warbles
[01:36.31]But how could I escape
[01:42.71]No further hesitation

[00:23.29]Pulses flutter and sting
[00:26.52]Within this bleakness
[00:43.18]Pain will come with the blade
[00:46.53]Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world somehow
[00:56.60]Unsheathe a sword not to kill
[00:59.86]Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
[01:05.43]Wake up, it's time to gather now
[01:09.69]The only warmth remains in hands clasped so tight
[01:16.33]The only fire exists in brave hearts
[01:23.13]Seasons that refuse to change over the years
[01:29.96]Will find their way back, back on track
[01:44.96]We've made a choice
[01:45.96]Go fight against your fate!
[01:49.84]Pain will come with the blade
[01:53.14]Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world somehow
[02:03.20]Unsheathe a sword not to kill
[02:06.52]Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
[02:12.07]Wake up, it's time to gather now
[02:24.25]Forget about the rules
[02:26.48]Written on weathered rock
[02:28.60]There were chasers of light
[02:30.72]find the way or get lost
[02:33.05]We have no way to know
[02:35.22]Where they all headed for
[02:37.43]See a light from afar
[02:39.46]Just blaze through the thorns
[02:41.62]We know it's right over there
[02:43.78]We have something to declare
[02:46.29]Whatever is arriving, we'll be prepared
[02:58.33]We've made a choice
[02:59.27]Go fight against your fate!
[03:03.12]Pain will come with the blade
[03:06.35]Pain will wake up the despondent crowd in this dormant world somehow
[03:16.18]Unsheathe a sword not to kill
[03:19.74]Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground
[03:25.36]Wake up to hear the cheering sound
